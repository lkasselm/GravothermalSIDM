Main features
-------------

GravothermalSIDM starts with a specified initial halo, divided into discrete radial bins, and tracks its gravothermal evolution.
The evolution proceeds by alternating between conducting heat across the radial bins over a short time and enforcing quasistatic equilibrium.
Snapshots of the halo properties are saved as the halo evolves.

Options for initial halo profiles:
* NFW
* Hernquist
* Isothermal

Options for the SIDM cross section:
* constant (velocity independent)
* power-law velocity dependence
* Yukawa scattering, Yukawa scattering via only t-channel

Getting started
---------------

Download the code from GitHub:
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/kboddy/GravothermalSIDM.git
```

Install the following Python package dependencies:
```console
$ pip install numpy scipy astropy h5py numba mpmath
```

As a simple example, run
```console
$ python runHaloEvolution.py
```

The Jupyter notebook `tutorial.ipynb` displays the documentation for the setup and run options.
